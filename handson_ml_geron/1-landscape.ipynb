    "### 1. How would you define Machine Learning?\n",
    "A type of computer programming where rather being given precise and explicit instructions on how to solve a given problem, the computer is given a set of general behaviors based on the data's statistical properties. From there, the program is able to self correct and tune itself through a series of training where the computer learns from examples. \n",

    "### 2. Name four types of problems where it shines?\n",
    "1. Solving for a system that has a lot of complex rules\n",
    "2. Complex problems where traditional methods fail\n",
    "3. Fluctuating environment\n",
    "4. Getting insights about complex problems with large amounts of data\n",

    "### 3. What is a labeled training set?\n",
    "It is the data set the ML algorithm uses to learn from and adjust its parameters to fit.\n",

    "### 4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?\n",
    "1. Classification\n",
    "2. Regression \n",

    "1. Clustering\n",
    "2. Anomaly detection\n",
    "3. Dim reduction\n",
    "4. Association rule learning\n",

    "### 6. Robot to walk in various terrain?\n",
    "- Need computer vision algorithms to determine terrain. Neural network perhaps.\n",
    "- GaN or other reinforcement learning for learning how to walk or physically traverse terrain.\n",
